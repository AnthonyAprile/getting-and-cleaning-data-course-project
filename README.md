Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data" Project
Below is an explanation of what is included in my course project for "Getting and Cleaning Data."
The, run_analysis.R script performs the following tasks in sequential order:

 - Downloads and unzips the UCI dataset if it does not already exist
 - Reads the data into tables
 - Assigns appropriate column names
 - Merges the data into one complete set
 - Finds the mean and standard deviation and puts it into a tidy data set
 - Writes the results to a text file called second_tidySet.txt
